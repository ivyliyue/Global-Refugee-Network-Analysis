# Global-Refugee-Network-Analysis

This project is aimed to study the global refugee movement in order to discover latent refugee migration patterns. Analysis focused on identifying and comparing sub-refugee communities and the relationship between these countries in terms of refugee in-flow and out-flow, as well as the role GDP plays. Techniques include giant component, the computing of edge density, global and locla transitivity, assortativity, community detection using walk trap algorithms, computing centrality measures, and so on.
